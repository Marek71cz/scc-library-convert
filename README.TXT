Project moved to a new repository under Stream Cinema Community project:
https://gitlab.com/stream-cinema-community/library-tool

This plugin works as a conversion utility. It converts your movies and TV shows library to the latest Stream Cinema Community format.
It does not work 100% correctly for TV shows if there is a mismatch between old Stream Cinema CZ SK and new Stream Cinema Comunity. For example, if some episodes are in old SC and not in new SCC, they are missing after conversion. 
Utility works the way that it deletes all episodes of old SC format and adds new episodes of new SCC format. After conversion, library scan is invoked.
